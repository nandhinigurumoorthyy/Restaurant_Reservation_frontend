- Uses MongoDB for user data storage.

#### **Frontend - Login.js & Signup.js**:
- Simple forms that capture user credentials and communicate with the backend via Axios.

### 2. **Profile Page**:

### 3. **Reservation Page**:

2. **Filters**: Filters allow users to narrow down restaurants by cuisine, price range, location, etc.
3. **Reservation**: Users can select a date, party size, and time to make a reservation, which is sent to the backend via Axios.
4. **Review**: Users can leave reviews for the restaurants they visited.
5. **Profile**: Users can manage their profile, view past reservations, and review history.
